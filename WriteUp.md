An easy start just give permission and run the binary file.

Using ```strings``` to diplay readable txt

Decoding base64 txt we get flag

## CrackMe4
Just know basic assembly cmds like MOV, LEA, CMP, ADD, SUB, PUSH, POP, Je, Jmp, Jne, Test. For a list of useful assembly instructions, check out [Assembly Ops](./assembly_ops.md).

Now that we hv that cleared we open radare2
```bash
r2 -d crackme4
```
To run with argument,
```bash
r2 -d ./crackme4 <argument>
```
### cmds in r2: 
aaa(to search commands), afl (to search running functions), pdf @<function_name>,

db <Break_address> (breakpt),  dc (run with breakpt), px @<register_name> (value in register)

![crackme4](screenshots/crackme4.1.png)  ![crackme4](screenshots/crackme4.2.png)

Run ```aaa``` then ```afl``` to list out all functions. We're always interested in the main function so ``pdf @main``.
In main we see sym.compare_pwd thats where the input string and passwd will be compared so ```pdf @sym.compare_pwd```.
Ignoring everything n going straight to call sym.imp.strcmp which is function compare to strings  . It takes two arguments 
rdi and rsi one of that is our input other will be the compared password. So if u see the value in the register at that instance 
one should contain the actual passwd. For that we set breakpoint ``db <address`` and run it using ``dc``

## CrackMe5
Same we'll use radare ```r2 -d crackme5```
```aaa```, ```pdf "main``` Search for function that c0mpare then set breakpt n run with it

We can also see that the passwd was infront of us

## CrackMe6
Same procedure got to main function then see for functions that are sus or are called before a desired outcome(like correct passwd).
For this its sym.my_secure_test. By looking at the code u can tell that its comparing each character of input with certain characters.
The value of that is displayed at the side in red by r2.

## CrackMe7
You can run the binary and see how things work im straight up going in r2 -d crackme8, pdf @main.
Ignoring all the code n going to the part where flag/passwd is decided

![crackme7](screenshots/crackme7.1.png) 

The user input is compared to a hex value 0x7a69 converting that into decimal and done

## CrackMe8
For this we going to use ghidra, which make its super easy and saves a lot of time. After creating a project on ghidra and import crackme8 in it.
Go to functions main,

![crackme8](screenshots/crackme8.png)

You can try with r2 but ghidra just better. r2 is just good for understanding the basics reverse engineering will be useful somewhere....probably -_o
